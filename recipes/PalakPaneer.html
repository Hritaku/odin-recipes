        <li>Puree to a smooth paste and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add the oil and then add the remaining 2 cloves of chopped garlic. Sauté for few minutes until it starts changing color. Then add the chopped onions.Cook the onion for 2 to 3 minutes until soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add in the prepared spinach puree and mix. Also add around 1/2 cup water at the point.Cover the pan and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium heat. The spinach will bubble a lot. Stir at regular intervals to avoid sticking at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once the spinach is cooked, add the garam masala, turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt. Mix and cook for 1 minute
            You may also add ½ teaspoon of sugar at this point if you like.
